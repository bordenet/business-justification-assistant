    "content": "# Executive Summary\n\nThis proposal requests $150K to reduce customer churn by 50%, yielding $1M annual savings. ROI: 567%. Payback: 2 months.\n\n# Problem\n\nOur customers struggle with onboarding, leading to 40% churn in the first month. According to Gartner 2024, industry average is 15%. This costs the business $2 million annually in lost revenue (source: Q3 Finance Report). Before: 40% churn. After: 20% churn target.\n\n# Financial Justification\n\n## ROI Calculation\n- Annual benefit: $1M (50% of $2M churn cost)\n- Implementation cost: $150K\n- ROI: (1,000,000 - 150,000) / 150,000 × 100 = 567%\n\n## Payback Period\nWith monthly savings of $83K and upfront cost of $150K, payback is achieved in 2 months.\n\n## 3-Year TCO\n- Year 1: $150K implementation + $20K ops = $170K\n- Year 2: $20K ops\n- Year 3: $20K ops\n- Total: $210K vs $3M benefit = 14:1 return\n\n# Options Analysis\n\n## Option 1: Do Nothing\nContinue losing $2M annually. Risk: competitor gains 10% market share. Cost of inaction: $6M over 3 years.\n\n## Option 2: Minimal Investment ($50K)\nBasic improvements only. Expected 20% churn reduction. Phase 1 only.\n\n## Option 3: Full Solution ($150K) - RECOMMENDED\nComplete guided onboarding. Expected 50% churn reduction. Best ROI.\n\n**Recommendation**: Option 3 provides highest ROI with acceptable risk level.\n\n# Risks\n\n1. **User adoption risk** - Mitigation: A/B testing, gradual rollout\n2. **Technical integration risk** - Mitigation: Phased approach, fallback plan\n3. **Timeline risk** - Mitigation: Buffer weeks built in\n\n# Stakeholders\n\n- **Finance**: Approved budget, concerned about payback period (addressed: 2 months)\n- **HR**: Training requirements identified\n- **Legal**: No compliance concerns\n- **Owner**: Product Team (John Smith)\n- **Accountable**: VP Product\n\n# Timeline\n\n## Phase 1: Discovery (Week 1-2)\n- User research\n- Competitive analysis\n\n## Phase 2: Build (Week 3-8)\n- Development and QA\n\n## Phase 3: Launch (Week 9)\n- Staged rollout",
